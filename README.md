# Curable_PitchDeck
I have worked extensively on a medical tourism startup, focusing on the business aspects, market analysis, and product management frameworks that drive its success. As part of my contributions, I researched the rapidly expanding medical tourism industry, particularly in India, and identified opportunities in Tier-2 cities to cater to the growing demand for high-quality, affordable healthcare, especially orthopaedic procedures like hip and knee replacements.

Throughout my involvement, I analysed the business model of the startup, which curates a centralised, full-stack platform that connects international patients with trusted Indian hospitals. This involved understanding the complexities of customer acquisition, the challenges of cross-border logistics, and the emotional and financial concerns medical travellers face. I focused on refining market positioning, revenue streams, and go-to-market strategies, integrating social media, crowdfunding platforms, and B2B partnerships to reach the target audience effectively.

In addition, I contributed to the development of product management frameworks for seamless patient facilitation, from initial inquiries to post-operative care. I helped design the platformâ€™s architecture, ensuring that it integrates trusted hospital networks, telemedicine services, and post-op wellness solutions into a transparent, user-friendly experience. I worked on creating a compelling value proposition by focusing on affordability, bundled packages, and an efficient, multi-lingual support system to address the diverse needs of international patients.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of business strategy but also deepened my expertise in product development, especially in a complex, cross-cultural environment. It has also improved my ability to tackle logistical challenges, create scalable solutions, and contribute to data-driven decision-making in the healthcare space.
